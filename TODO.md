# Ideas and plans

Some things to do:

## Containers

Using void \* allocated memory and wrapping code in simple C macros, it should
be possible to build many common type generic containers with at least some of
the functionality and expressiveness of C++ stl. This may include simple lists,
an unordered map, a range-safe vector, and similar kinds of things.
